# Cosmos.jl

A Julia package that wraps `Cosmology.jl` in a (personally) more convenient form.

This is largely based on `Cosmology.jl`, with some additions from:
"Distance Measures in Cosmology", by D. W. Hogg, [astro-ph/9905116](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9905116).

## Quick start

- This package requires Julia 1.8. Older versions will not be supported.
- `] add Cosmos`
- `using Cosmos`


## Source documentation


```@meta
