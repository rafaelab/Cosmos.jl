# Cosmos.jl

A Julia package that wraps and extends [Cosmology.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/Cosmology.jl/) to what I consider to be a more convenient form.
Things should work, but the code has not yet been thoroughly tested.


This is largely based on `Cosmology.jl`, with some additions from:
"Distance Measures in Cosmology", by D. W. Hogg, [astro-ph/9905116](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9905116).
